I am a PhD student working under supervision of Prof. [Jean-François Raskin](http://di.ulb.ac.be/verif/jfr/) at [Formal Methods and Verification group](http://di.ulb.ac.be/verif/) in Département d'Informatique, Université Libre de Bruxelles.

Previously, I received my MSc in Computer Science and BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/).

| **Safe Learning for Near Optimal Scheduling**<br/>Damien Busatto-Gaston, Debraj Chakraborty, Shibashis Guha, Guillermo A. Pérez and Jean-François Raskin| QEST, 2021 |
|We investigate the combination of synthesis, model-based learning, and online sampling techniques to obtain safe and near-optimal schedulers for a preemptible task scheduling problem. Our algorithms can handle Markov decision processes (MDPs) that have 10<sup>20</sup> states and beyond which cannot be handled with state-of-the art probabilistic model-checkers. We provide probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees for learning the model. Additionally, we extend Monte-Carlo tree search with advice, computed using safety games or obtained using the earliest-deadline-first scheduler, to safely explore the learned model online. Finally, we implemented and compared our algorithms empirically against shielded deep Q-learning on large task systems. |[[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09253.pdf)<br/>[[Video]](https://di.ulb.ac.be/verif/debraj/files/QEST21_talk.mp4)<br/>[[Slides]](https://di.ulb.ac.be/verif/debraj/files/QEST21_slides.pdf)|
| **Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by Symbolic Advice for MDPs**<br/>Damien Busatto-Gaston, Debraj Chakraborty and Jean-François Raskin| CONCUR, 2020 |
|We consider the online computation of a strategy that aims at optimizing the expected average reward in an MDP. It is computed with a receding horizon and using MCTS. We augment the MCTS algorithm with the notion of symbolic advice, and show that its classical theoretical guarantees are maintained. We describe how to use QBF and SAT solvers to implement symbolic advice in an efficient way. We illustrate our new algorithm using the popular game Pac-Man and show that the performances of our algorithm exceed those of plain MCTS as well as the performances of human players.|[[pdf]](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2020/12852/pdf/LIPIcs-CONCUR-2020-40.pdf)<br/>[[Video]](https://di.ulb.ac.be/verif/debraj/files/CONCUR20_talk.mp4)<br/>[[Slides]](https://di.ulb.ac.be/verif/debraj/files/CONCUR20_slides.pdf)<br/>[[More]](https://di.ulb.ac.be/verif/debraj/pacman/)|
